        <p>My wife hates when I do offers like this because she knows that I can sell each of these courses for their full value on their own and even raise the prices if I wanted to.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s be honest though. <strong>Not everyone has $700 laying around to spend on some courses.</strong></p> 
        <p>That&rsquo;s why you are being given this shot at purchasing all 3 of these awesome courses for just $147.</p>
        <p>However, I am not going to keep this open forever. As you go through the <em>7-Day List-Building Challenge</em>, I will let you know more about the <em>1,000 Subscribers</em> course and you will see each time the price will go up closer to its $447 launch price.</p>
        <p><strong>This offer is for 3 days only.</strong></p>
        <p>What happens when the 3 days are up? The package will still be around, but it will shoot up another $100.</p>
        <p>You can invest $147 now in making sure you build the business that you crave or you can invest $691 later to do the same.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center">60-Day Money Back Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Every single course has a 60-Day Money Back Guarantee once you start. If you feel you aren&rsquo;t getting the value you thought from a course, then simply ask for your money back and I will refund you without hesitation.</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t think that will happen though because you will be too busy checking your subscriber numbers.</p>
