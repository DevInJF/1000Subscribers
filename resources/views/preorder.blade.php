        <p>Some people think you need to wait months or years before making money with your blog.</p>
        <p>Wrong.</p>
        <p>Pinterest allows you to get an instant bolt of traffic that will help you make money from day 1.</p>
        <p>In fact, <strong>I made $1,000 in the first 60 days using Pinterest</strong> and I didn&rsquo;t have to resort to ads.</p>
        <p>In this course you will learn how to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Setup your Pinterest profile for success</li>
          <li>Figure out what boards you should be creating</li>
          <li>Make the perfect Pinterest pin</li>

      <div class="small-12 large-6 columns">
        <p>It&rsquo;s impossible to build your list effectively if you don&rsquo;t know where your traffic coming from and how well it is converting.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics is the most popular analytics tool on the planet because it is free and powerful.</p>
        <p>It can also be a bit complicated to understand.</p>
        <p>In this course you will learn how to navigate through Google Analytics better than your own house.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;ll finally be able to set up goals and events to continually monitor your blog and improve it.</p>

        <p>My wife hates when I do offers like this because she knows that I can sell each of these courses for their full value on their own and even raise the prices if I wanted to.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s be honest though. <strong>Not everyone has $700 laying around to spend on some courses.</strong></p> 
        <p>That&rsquo;s why you are being given this shot at purchasing all 3 of these awesome courses for just $147.</p>
        <p>However, I am not going to keep this open forever. As you go through the <em>7-Day List-Building Challenge</em>, I will let you know more about the <em>1,000 Subscribers</em> course and you will see each time the price will go up closer to its $447 pricepoint.</p>
        <p><strong>Only 100 people can take advantage of this offer.</strong> Most people will skip this page or not read down this far. You have so this is your chance.</p>
        <p>No pressure, but once 100 people scoop up this package it is gone forever.</p>
        <p>You can invest $147 no in making sure you build the business that you crave or you can invest $691 later to do the same.</p>
