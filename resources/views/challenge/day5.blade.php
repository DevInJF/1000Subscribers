			<p>I have a friend that is terrible with women. I mean absolutely no game at all. We&rsquo;ve been friends for over 22 years and I think I have seen him throw the same game at girls for all 22 of those years.</p>
			<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
			<p>And guess what? He think it will work eventually.</p>
			<p>That sounds crazy right?</p>
			<p>Why would someone do something repeatedly, see the results, and then continue to do it?</p>
			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to try some things out, check the results, and then see how you can improve upon them?</p>
			<p>Yes.</p>
			<h2>Optimize, Optimize, Optimize</h2>
			<p>One of the worst things you can do is to blindly follow every single thing that I tell you. Not just me either. Anybody.</p>
			<p>You should definitely listen to everything I tell you, but instead of assuming it works you should see for yourself.</p>
			<p>Yesterday we talked about content upgrades.
