			<p>Here is the scenario.</p>
			<p>You have a big meeting with a famous actor.</p>
			<p>The goal is to get the famous actor to donate to your world famous charity.</p>
			<p>Yes, you are big time.</p>
			<p>So how do you go about ensuring that you give yourself the best chance of getting a donation?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Do you ask them over and order takeout?</li>
				<li>Do you take them out to an extravagant dinner?</li>
				<li>Do you show them the purpose of your charity and the good that it does?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It really depends on the actor&rsquo;s personality, but most of you probably went with #3 and it&rsquo;s a good choice.</p>
			<p>Why? Because it sets the stage for things to come and gets the person in the right mindset.</p>
			<p>This is what your blog&rsquo;s homepage does.</p>
			<p>It sets the tone and gets the reader into the right mindset.</p>
			<h2>Your #1 Page</h2>
			<p>When taking a look at your analytics you will always find that your homepage is one of your most popular pages. It makes sense because people like to click on that big logo at the top of the page to get taken back to the beginning.</p>
			<p><strong>Because your homepage is so popular, it is one of the best opportunities you have to gain subscribers</strong> and yet so many people let it go to waste.</p>
			<p>Instead of treating your homepage like a landing page, you probably treat it like a blog listing page. The logic being that when people come to your homepage they want to see the rest of your blog posts and you are right, they do.</p>
			<p>But they can see blog posts on almost every other page on your site. Let your homepage take on a different job.</p>
			<p>When people visit your homepage, this is your chance to let them know what your site is about to also entice them with an offer they would be crazy to refuse.</p>
			<p>Instead of talking about yourself, talk about the benefits that a person will get from being on your site.</p>
			<p>I call this your <em>promise to your audience</em>.</p>
			<p><em>If you&rsquo;re curious about learning more on your promise and your Why then check out the free <a href="https://obstacle.co/cultivate-tribe/">Cultivating Your Tribe</a> email course.</em></p>
			<h2>The Hero Section</h2>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how some popular bloggers handle their promises to their audiences.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://byregina.com">By Regina</a></h3>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://byregina.com"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/03232028/byregina.com_.jpg"></a></div>

			<div class="image"><a href="http://chrisducker.com"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/03234131/chrisducker.com_.jpg"></a></div>
			<h3><a href="http://www.femtrepreneur.co/">Femtrepreneur</a></h3>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://www.femtrepreneur.co/"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/03234742/femtrepreneur.co_.jpg"></a></div>
			<p>Notice that every single one is trying to grab a subscriber right off the bat. The hero section, that&rsquo;s the giant section you see at the top of a lot sites, is the one section that doesn&rsquo;t get ignored by readers.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity to put your arm around your reader&rsquo;s shoulder and make them an offer. All they have to do is give you their email.</p>
			<p>What is even better about this technique is that you don&rsquo;t have to resort to pop-ups.</p>
			<p>I understand why people like to use pop-ups, they are super effective, but they are also super annoying.</p>
			<p><strong>You can get the same kind of attention using your hero section effectively as you could by placing a giant, content-blocking pop-up on your page.</strong></p>
			<h2>The Paths</h2>
			<p>What happens after someone goes past your hero section? Is that where you provide them with a lovely list of your blog posts?</p>
			<p>You can, but there is a better use of this real estate.</p>
			<p>Odds are that you have a couple of different actions that you want someone to take when they visit your site.</p>
			<p>Maybe you have 3 separate email sequences that people can join. Maybe you are a freelancer and you want people to contact you about your services. Maybe you have a YouTube channel that you would love for people to check out.</p>
			<p>What a lot of people will do is put this kind of stuff in the sidebar, but the sidebar is largely ignored. The web has been around for over 20 years and sidebars were there on day 1 so your audience has grown accustomed to not paying attention to them.</p>
			<p>Instead you can give them another section that lays out some clear paths that you want them to follow.</p>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://melyssagriffin.com"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/11025047/melyssa_griffin_paths.png"></a></div>
			<p>Here is the section <a href="http://melyssagriffin.com">Melyssa Griffin</a> has under her hero section.</p>
			<p>As you can see she has done a nice job of laying out 3 clear paths for her audience to follow:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sign up for a free workshop</li>
				<li>View her e-courses</li>
				<li>Join her Facebook community</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These are all paths that help her business out, while also providing some type of value to the reader.</p>
			<p>Look at the logic of having a section like this right after the hero. A person sees the hero offer, but decides it might not be for them or maybe they want to browse more.</p>
			<p>Right away they are presented with 3 more offers (paths) that they can make a decision about.</p>
			<p>Overall, you are showing 4 different options to your reader to get them to take a specific action and none of this looks sleazy in any way.</p>
			<p>Notice that you are not being pushy. You are simply presenting value to your audience and making sure they know about it. Doing anything less would be an injustice to your hard work and your audience.</p>
			<h2>How Many Exits?</h2>
			<p>If the #1 goal of your homepage is to convert readers into subscribers, what kind of things can you do to sabotage that?</p>
			<p>Well, first and foremost, you could present them with options that don&rsquo;t lead to them becoming subscribers. Usually this means taking them to other pages or posts on your site.</p>
			<p>However, this isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal as we will see on Day 4 as long as you are using other methods to convert them.</p>
			<p>What about ads or affiliate offers that might take them to an external site? What are the chances of them coming back?</p>
			<p>Could you imagine owning a sushi restaurant where you had a really nice lobby and before you were able to sit anyone down, they went off to the ice cream shop because you told them how nice it was?</p>
			<p>It sounds silly, but this is what you are doing when you give people an opportunity to leave your site.</p>
			<p>They leave.</p>
			<p><strong>Your homepage should act as a gateway to everything else you are offering.</strong> It shouldn&rsquo;t contain exit doors. If people want to leave they can click the back button. They don&rsquo;t need your assistance.</p>
			<p>You don&rsquo;t want to trap your visitors on your homepage, but you also don&rsquo;t want to show them the door.</p>
			<h2>Can I Scan That for You?</h2>
			<p><strong>It is important that the design of your homepage is scannable.</strong> What this means is that when someone comes to your site, they like to do a quick scroll of everything to assess the situation.</p>
			<p>What you want to make sure of is that your homepage&rsquo;s design has distinct sections to it that let the reader know they need to stop and read what is going on.</p>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the <a href="https://obstacle.co">Obstacle.co homepage</a>.</p>
			<div class="image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/11054343/obstaclecohome.jpg"></div>
			<p>As you can see the homepage is broken up into 5 distinct sections.</p> 
			<p>The first three sections have calls to action in the hopes of converting visitors into suscribers. The remaining two sections are there to reinforce the purpose of the site and to add authority.</p>
			<p>Even if you quickly scan the page your eyes can&rsquo;t help but pause on certain section since they break the flow of the design.</p>
			<p>In the case of Obstacle.co you don&rsquo;t need to make the background of each section as distinctly unique as I did. However, you do wnat to ensure it&rsquo;s easy to know when a new section appears.</p>
			<h2>Nothing Is Too Obvious</h2>
			<p>You&rsquo;re sitting at your desk in your 4th period math class right behind your crush. Every day you two talk and in your mind you&rsquo;ve drop obvious hints that you like them, but they don&rsquo;t seem to respond.</p>
			<p>Weeks go by until finally your crush starts dating someone else (yes, in 4th grade). You&rsquo;re heartbroken and you ask your crush why they didn&rsquo;t choose you.</p>
			<p>Their answer is simple.</p>
			<p>They didn&rsquo;t know you liked them.</p>
			<p>...</p>
			<p>People can&rsquo;t read your mind. If you want them to sign up for your mailing list, then you need to make it obvious. Don&rsquo;t try to be subtle with your forms and buttons. Make them plainly obvious.</p>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://smartblogger.com"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/11055526/smartblogger.png"></a></div>
			<p>This is <a href="http://smartblogger.com">SmartBlogger</a> by Jon Morrow. As you can see they make their incentive offer obvious. The button is orange and there is even an arrow pointing to the form.</p>
			<p>There is no way you could miss this offer.</p>
			<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be obnoxious with your design, but you do need to be obvious.</p>
			<p>There is no reason to be shy if you are offering huge value to your audience.</p>
			<h2>The Honey Trap</h2>
			<p>Your homepage is the most obvious honey trap you have on your site. Over time you will create specific landing pages for different offers, but your first landing page will always be your homepage.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest opportunities you have to grab subscribers so don&rsquo;t waste it.</p>
			<h2>Today&rsquo;s Tasks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Put an offer front and center for your audience on the homepage. Even if this is just for them to sign up to receive updates.</li>
				<li>Look at all of the different exit points (links to go to 3rd party sites) on your homepage and get rid of them.</li>
				<li>Take a screenshot of your homepage (I use <em>Full Page Screen Capture</em> Chrome extension) and check to see how scannable your page is</li>
				<li>Make sure all of your CTAs (call-to-action) are obvious. A form should look like a form and a button should look like a button.</li>
