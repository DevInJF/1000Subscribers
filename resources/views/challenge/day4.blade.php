			<p>Have you heard the analogy of dangling a carrot on a stick to get someone to do something?</p>
			<p>That is what you need to do to gain subscribers.</p>
			<p>How many companies do you think have your email address on file now? Way too many to count. How many of them do cool things with your email address like send you awesome content that you love? Very few.</p>
			<p>We all suffer from email fatigue. Although we are used to giving out our email addresses, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we want to hand them out to everyone.</p>
			<p>You want to make sure that it&rsquo;s worth the time and effort to receive an email from another person. The idea is to receive less email, not more!</p>
			<p>This is where content upgrades come into play.</p>
			<h2>What Is a Content Upgrade?</h2>
			<p>If you&rsquo;ve been reading blogs for more than a week then you&rsquo;ve come across a content upgrade or lead magnet.</p>
			<p>The general idea is that you give people some piece of valuable content in exchange for their email address.</p>
			<div class="image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/15184118/contentupgrades.png" data-pin-nopin="true"></div>
			<p>Here you can see a content upgrade by <a href="http://www.katedoster.com/emailideas/">Kate Doster</a>. The post is about what to send your email list when you have no clue what to say and the content upgrade is adding more ideas to send them.</p>
			<p>The content upgrade complements the blog post. You want do make sure your content upgrade is relevant to your post because it&rsquo;s all about context.</p>
			<h3>It&rsquo;s All About Context</h3>
			<p>Imagine you want to grab some lobster tonight. You find the best seafood restaurant in town and head on over.</p>
			<p>As you sit down your waiter tells you the specials and tries to upsell you on some fried chicken wings.</p>
			<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Everyone loves chicken wings, but in the context of a seafood restaurant, there is no place for chicken wings!</p>
			<p>When providing a content upgrade if you want to ensure that your conversion rate is as high as possible you need to keep everything in context.</p>
			<h2>Different Types of Upgrades</h2>
			<p>This is where a lot of people get stuck. They have no idea what kind of content upgrades they should provide.</p>
			<p>There is no king of content upgrades. There are a ridiculous amount of options at your disposal. Here are a couple:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Worksheets</li>
				<li>Checklists</li>
				<li>Ebooks</li>
				<li>Email courses</li>
			</ol>
			<p>My personal favorite is the email course content upgrade because it provides further continuous value to your audience and also acts as a funnel.</p>
			<p>But as I said before, there is no perfect content upgrade. If it makes sense to use a checklist as a content upgrade for a specific post then use that. Don&rsquo;t try to force a content upgrade just because you like the idea of it.</p>
			<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
			<p>So you have a great content upgrade. Congrats. Where do you put it?</p>
			<p>You have a number of options and bloggers always seem to have their own opinions on what works best.</p>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s explore some of the different location options you have at your disposal.</p>
			<h3>The Hero</h3>
			<p>The Hero Section of your site is the big top area. Not every theme/design has this, but it&rsquo;s a pretty common feature today.</p>
			<p>Scroll to the top of this page and you&rsquo;ll see the hero section right under the navigation.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s the one section of a design that nobody skips because it&rsquo;s right in front of your face. This makes it prime real estate to include an offer.</p>
			<p>Check out how <a href="http://byregina.com">Regina</a> uses the hero section to great effect.</p>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://byregina.com"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/03232028/byregina.com_.jpg"></a></div>
			<p>That appears on every single page so it will never be missed by anyone. It is in your face, but it isn&rsquo;t bothersome.</p>
			<h3>After the Blog Post</h3>
			<p>This is one of the most ideal locations. Your reader just got done reading your awesome content and are hyped up on the subject matter. It&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity to present them with an offer.</p>
			<p>Look how Adrianna presents an awesome content upgrade right after her post.</p>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://mintswift.com/blog/pinterest-visibility/"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/22050732/mintswiftcontentupgrade.png"></a></div>
			<p>Her readers learn all about how she grew her Pinterest visibility by 500% in one month and then are presented with a free BoardBooster e-book tutorial.</p>
			<p>You best believe people are going to sign up for that!</p>
			<h3>Within the Post</h3>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s say you wrote a ridiculously awesome post that has people drooling for a solution. After the first two paragraphs they want what you&rsquo;re offering. After 10 paragraphs they still want whatever it is.</p>
			<p>Should you make them scroll to the bottom to get it?</p>
			<p>You don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
			<p>You can offer your content upgrade within your blog post.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.melyssagriffin.com/pinterest-strategies/">Melyssa Griffin</a> is a wizard at doing this and it has worked wonders for her.</p>
			<div class="image"><a href="http://www.melyssagriffin.com/pinterest-strategies/"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/22051223/melyssagriffincontentupgrade.png"></a></div>
			<p>Be smart about your placement and do not just plop it down anywhere. Place it in a spot that follows up on an excellent point. Make it seem like the content upgrade is going to reinforce that point.</p>
			<h3>Sidebar and Footer</h3>
			<p>These are two other popular locations that you should try out. I usually don&rsquo;t work with sidebars because I like my content to stand out, but if you are going to utilize one, then you might as well get the most out of it.</p>
			<p>I like having content upgrades in footers because it&rsquo;s similar to the PS in a letter or email.</p>
			<p>Everybody scrolls down to the bottom to read.</p>
			<p>If you are going to put something in the sidebar or footer then it will have to be one of your generic content upgrades that applies to most of your audience.</p>
			<h2>Content Upgrades Are a Must</h2>
			<p>The days of asking people to just sign up for regular updates is over. Everybody gets enough spam so they don&rsquo;t need more.</p>
			<p>Use the rule of reciprocity to get their email address by giving them something great in return.</p>
			<p>The increase in subscribers you&rsquo;ll get with content upgrades can not be understated.</p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t launch a site until I have one or two content upgrades ready to go out the door.</p>
			<h2>Today&rsquo;s Tasks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If you already have a blog, go through your most popular posts and try to think of some awesome content upgrades you can offer for them.</li>
				<li>If you don&rsquo;t have a blog yet, then think about a mini-email course or ebook that you can create over a weekend.</li>
