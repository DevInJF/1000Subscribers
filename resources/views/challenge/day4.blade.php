			<p>Have you heard the analogy of dangling a carrot on a stick to get someone to do something?</p>
			<p>That is what you need to do to gain subscribers.</p>
			<p>How many companies do you think have your email address on file now? Way too many to count. How many of them do cool things with your email address like send you awesome content that you love? Very few.</p>
			<p>We all suffer from email fatigue. Although we are used to giving out our email addresses, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we want to hand them out to everyone.</p>
			<p>You want to make sure that it&rsquo;s worth the time and effort to receive an email from another person. The idea is to receive less email, not more!</p>
			<p>This is where content upgrades come into play.</p>
			<h2>What Is a Content Upgrade?</h2>
			<p>If you&rsquo;ve been reading blogs for more than a week then you&rsquo;ve come across a content upgrade or lead magnet.</p>
			<p>The general idea is that you give people some piece of valuable content in exchange for their email address.</p>
			<div class="image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obstacleco-assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/15184118/contentupgrades.png" data-pin-nopin="true"></div>
			<p>Here you can see a content upgrade by <a href="http://www.katedoster.com/emailideas/">Kate Doster</a>. The post is about what to send your email list when you have no clue what to say and the content upgrade is adding more ideas to send them.</p>
			<p>The content upgrade complements the blog post. You want do make sure your content upgrade is relevant to your post because it&rsquo;s all about context.</p>
			<h3>It&rsquo;s All About Context</h3>
			<p>Imagine you want to grab some lobster tonight. You find the best seafood restaurant in town and head on over.</p>
			<p>As you sit down your waiter tells you the specials and tries to upsell you on some fried chicken wings.</p>
			<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Everyone loves chicken wings, but in the context of a seafood restaurant, there is no place for chicken wings!</p>
			<p>When providing a content upgrade if you want to ensure that your conversion rate is as high as possible you need to keep everything in context.</p>
			<h2>Different Types of Upgrades</h2>
			<p>This is where a lot of people get stuck. They have no idea what kind of content upgrades they should provide.</p>
			<p>There is no king of content upgrades. There are a ridiculous amount of options at your disposal. Here are a couple:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Worksheets</li>
				<li>Checklists</li>
				<li>Ebooks</li>
				<li>Email courses</li>
			</ol>
			<p>My personal favorite is the email course content upgrade because it provides further continuous value to your audience and also acts as a funnel.</p>
			<p>But as I said before, there is no perfect content upgrade. If it makes sense to use a checklist as a content upgrade for a specific post then use that. Don&rsquo;t try to force a content upgrade just because you like the idea of it.</p>
