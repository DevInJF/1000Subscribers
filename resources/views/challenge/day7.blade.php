			<p>You&rsquo;ve made it! This is the final day of the challenge and I am proud of you for getting to the end.</p>
			<p>Today we talk about one of the most well-converting things you can do for your blog. While one goal is to increase your mailing list, the other goal is to make money.</p>
			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome to do something that can accomplish both?</p>
			<p>Say hello to webinars.</p>
			<p>Webinars are live streams that you do where you teach something.</p>
			<p>They are awesome. They are high converting. And they should be done by everybody.</p>
			<p>What makes them so great?</p>
			<h2>Feeling a Connection</h2>
			<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for you to read these challenges and it&rsquo;s another for you to actually see me implement what you&rsquo;ve learned in these challenges.</p>
			<p>While I try my best to get my voice across in writing, it just doesn&rsquo;t match what can be done over video.</p>
			<p>Live video allows your audience to build a deeper connection with you.</p>
			<p>This is why you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see your webinars converting at 30%+ and this is why so many bloggers are doing them.</p>
			<h2>How to Do an Awesome Webinar</h2>
			<p>First things first. You need to think of a topic that will solve an issue for people. Ideally it is tied into one of your products, but if not, that&rsquo;s okay. Just find something to teach your audience.</p>
			<p>You aren&rsquo;t trying to host a seminar where you are selling a product. You are a teacher in a classroom showing students how to achieve a specific solution.</p>
			<p>A great webinar tackles a clear problem and offers an even clearer solution.</p>
			<p>But isn&rsquo;t that giving away your good content?</p>
			<p>Indeed. And there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
			<p>A webinar is essentially a test run for your course. If you can put on an awesome webinar then you&rsquo;ve provided the ultimate demo for your course.</p>
			<p>So what goes into a webinar?</p>
			<h3>Webinar Software</h3>
			<p>First and foremost you need to find webinar software that works for you. You have a number of different options. I run Obstacle.co&rsquo;s webinars on <a href="http://crowdcast.io">Crowdcast</a> and so far I am impressed.</p>
			<p>Another popular webinar tool is <a href="http://webinarjam.com">Webinar Jam</a>.</p>
			<p>The most popular one of them all though is Google Hangouts. It&rsquo;s popular because it is free. So why don&rsquo;t I use it? Because the tools you can use with it are limiting and Google Hangouts wasn&rsquo;t built for webinars.</p>
			<p><a href="http://crowdcast.io">Crowdcast</a> offers me all of the tools I need to ensure a successful webinar.</p>
			<h3>Presentation Software</h3>
			<p>More than likely your webinar is going to be similar to a presentation. The best way to do a presentation is by using something like Microsoft Powerpoint or Apple Keynote.</p>
			<p>Now if you&rsquo;re rolling your eyes because you are reminded of all of the boring slideshow presentations you&rsquo;ve had to sit through in your life then I don&rsquo;t blame you.</p>
			<p>And that is exactly why you need to make sure you knock your webinar out of the park.</p>
			<p>I like to do a quick intro where I show my face to let people get familiar with me and then I switch to the slideshow. Sometimes when I feel like I&rsquo;m have a good hair day I&rsquo;ll do a picture-in-picture with my face in the corner.</p>
			<h3>Proper Audio and Video</h3>
			<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t run a webinar without some quality audio. Video you might be able to get away with if you don&rsquo;t plan on showing your face but good audio is a must.</p>
			<p>That means you will have to shell out a little bit for a microphone. There are ton of awesome USB mics out there that cost under $100 and the investment is well worth it.</p>
			<p>You don&rsquo;t want your voice sounding like you work at the register of a drive-thru.</p>
			<h2>Gaining Subscribers</h2>
			<p>Alright but how does a webinar help you gain subscribers?</p>
			<p>Easy. You ask people to sign-up for your webinar by entering their email address.</p>
			<p>Crowdcast makes this easy and with <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> integration I can get all my registrants into Convertkit and an email sequence later on.</p>
			<h2>Today&rsquo;s Tasks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Look at your most popular content and see what topics really resonate with your audience. What problems are they trying to solve? Can you pick one and solve it in a webinar?</li>
				<li>Take a look at your calendar and plan out the next 90 days. Can you do 4 webinars in that time?</li>
				<li>Check out an <a href="https://obstacle.co/webinars">Obstacle.co Webinar</a> to see how I do things.</li>
