			<p>You&rsquo;ve made it! This is the final day of the challenge and I am proud of you for getting to the end.</p>
			<p>Today we talk about one of the most well-converting things you can do for your blog. While one goal is to increase your mailing list, the other goal is to make money.</p>
			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome to do something that can accomplish both?</p>
			<p>Say hello to webinars.</p>
			<p>Webinars are live streams that you do where you teach something.</p>
			<p>They are awesome. They are high converting. And they should be done by everybody.</p>
			<p>What makes them so great?</p>
			<h2>Feeling a Connection</h2>
			<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for you to read these challenges and it&rsquo;s another for you to actually see me implement what you&rsquo;ve learned in these challenges.</p>
			<p>While I try my best to get my voice across in writing, it just doesn&rsquo;t match what can be done over video.</p>
			<p>Live video allows your audience to build a deeper connection with you.</p>
			<p>This is why you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see your webinars converting at 30%+ and this is why so many bloggers are doing them.</p>
			<h2>How to Do an Awesome Webinar</h2>
			<p>First things first. You need to think of a topic that will solve an issue for people. Ideally it is tied into one of your products, but if not, that&rsquo;s okay. Just find something to teach your audience.</p>
			<p>You aren&rsquo;t trying to host a seminar where you are selling a product. You are essentially a teacher in a classroom showing students how to achieve a specific solution.</p>
