			<p>Giveaways are one of the best things you can do to build up your subscriber count.</p>
			<p>Could you imagine gaining <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/what-i-learned-from-growing-my-email-list-3418-nearly-200k-in-just-11-days/">200,000 new email addresses</a> in a short period of time?</p>
			<p>That is absolutely mind-boggling.</p>
			<p>However, you can&rsquo;t just put together any type of random giveaway. You have to put together something that appeals to your audience.</p>
			<p>How do you do that?</p>
			<p>Context.</p>
			<h2>Again, it&rsquo;s About Context</h2>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend you run a dog training blog. Good for you!</p>
			<p>You decide you want to do a giveaway where the prize is an iPad. That is a pretty damn good prize so you should expect a ton of people to sign up to win.</p>
			<p>In fact, a ton of people do sign up!</p>
			<p>There is just one problem.</p>
			<p>Most of these people don&rsquo;t care about anything else you do. When you send out your first non-iPad related email over 50% of them unsubscribe. They were there for the iPad, not dog training tips.</p>
			<p>This is where a lot of giveaways fail.</p>
			<p>Sure you want to give offer great prizes, but you want to make sure you are bringing in the right audience.</p>
