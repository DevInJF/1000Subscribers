			<p>The best bloggers understand that you need to use a number of different tactics to grow your audience.</p>
			<p><strong>The key is understanding what the different tactics are and where and when to use them.</strong></p>

			<p>It seems like every blogger you read is making good money for you.</p>
			<p>You&rsquo;ve tried ads and sponsored posts, but with so little traffic the most you make is $13 a month.</p>

			<p>Everybody has a dream lifestyle they want to live. Sometimes that involves traveling, sometimes that means spending more time with family, and sometimes it means flying to Mars. Either way, we each have a lifestyle that we want and therefore we are searching for ways to attain it.</p>
			<p>Obstacle.co was created to show you how you can achieve that lifestyle through blogs and online sites that amplify your passions.</p>
			<h3>Erm, Blogs?</h3>
			<p>Blogs?!</p>
			<p>Yes, blogs. Obstacle.co chronicles my journey of using blogs as a way to get towards my dream lifestyle. </p>
			<p>Why blogs? Well, you&#8217;re probably thinking of blogs with pictures of cats or gossip celebrity and while those are blogs, I&#8217;m talking about the type that offer value to people. Blogs allow your voice to get out there and are an easy way to provide awesome value to your tribe.</p>
			<h3>A Different Approach to Teaching</h3>
			<p>Obstacle.co is different from the other sites that teach you how to make money online. Most sites use only one site as an example of how to succeed and it&#8217;s always the site you are reading. That works well because then the site just continues to grow, but it always seems to be a site about how to make money.</p>
			<p>So is the only way you can make money online by creating a <em>how to make money online site</em>? Of course not, and that is what separates Obstacle.co.</p>
			<p>I&#8217;ll talk about the principles that I use on this site and the other blogs that I will be creating. Some of these blogs will be worked on solely by me, while others will be collaborations.</p>
