			<p>90 minutes.</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s how long it took me to get to work in the morning. I don&rsquo;t even want to tell you how long it took to get home.</p>
			<p>I never figured I was meant for this type of life. I enjoyed life too much to waste most of it sitting at a desk making someone else rich.</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I loved the people I worked with and did a lot of amazing things, but those 49 little voices in my head were always telling me that I should aim for something more.</p>
			<p>So I figured I was going to sell something online. I was going to write a book!</p>
			<p>I sold 0 copies.</p>
			<p>I was determined to make it on my own so I tried another book.</p>
			<p>I made $32.</p>
			<p>Sigh.</p>
			<p>I had to be doing something wrong because everyone else I saw online was making a killing with their products.</p>
			<p>Then I discovered the <em>secret</em>.</p>
			<p>They had an audience.</p>
			<p>More importantly, they had a mailing list of people waiting to buy from them.</p>

			<h2>Why I Created this Course</h2>
			<p>My name is Paul Scrivens and I&rsquo;m that goofy looking guy above.</p>
			<p>I created this course because of my parents.</p>
			<p>I have spent my whole life watching them work at jobs they didn&rsquo;t enjoy just so they could provide for my family.</p>
			<p>I created this course because of my friends.</p>
			<p>Every year they tell me stories about looking for something new.</p>
			<h3>I Created This Course for You</h3>
			<p>It&rsquo;s no fun trying to figure out how to grow your blog and make money. In fact, it can be infuriating watching others around you pull in money when you know they aren&rsquo;t smarter or more talented.</p>
			<p>You put in just as much work as anyone else and yet you aren&rsquo;t seeing the same results.</p>
			<p>That sucks.</p>
			<p>I have been in that boat before and I wanted to get off as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>This course was created so you don&rsquo;t have to go through the years of struggle that I did. It was created to provide you with a clear roadmap to success.</p>
			<p>Are you ready to follow it?</p>
